                <h1>What Is Coding?</h1>

                <p>

                    Coding, also known as computer programming, is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow, using specific programming languages. These instructions, or "code", tell the computer what actions to perform and how to process data. Essentially, it's a way for humans to communicate with computers, enabling the creation of software, applications, and websites.

                <p>
    
                    Python is easy to read and understand. Popular among both beginners and experienced developers. It offers a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.
    Python is an interpreted language, that runs code line by line. Unlike compiled languages, Python does not convert the code into machine code before running it.

                    Binary code comprises a series of zeros and ones, used to communicate instructions. This code is a low-level programming language. Each digit in a coded sequence connects to a switch in your computer. Each switch connects to an action, and together thousands of switches operate a device.

                <h1>How Does Coding Work?</h1>
    
                <p>
    
                    Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct
                    machines to complete specific actions. Computer coding functions much like a manual.
    
                    A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a
                    visual or to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks
                    that create and run a successful website or application.
